# BluetoothInterfaceAndroid
An app that is built using Android Studio and Java. Can be used to interface your android smartphone to a bluetooth device like HC-05 and transmit and receive data. 
It has 5 built in buttons that are mapped to control the direction of the motor(vehiche) in our case. But the buttons can be mapped to any values of choice by just long 
pressing and setting the value of them.
The UI of the app looks like below.
